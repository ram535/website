The purpose of this project is to reproduce and create a small text editor using the dart:html library.
I am basing this project from the book [Dart Scalable Application Develoment](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/dart-scalable-application-development).
The objetive of this project is to get familiar with the Dart Programming Language.
