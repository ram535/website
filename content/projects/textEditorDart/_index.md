The purpose of this project is to reproduce and create a small text editor using the dart:html library.
I am basing this project from the book [Dart Scalable Application Develoment](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/dart-scalable-application-development).
The objetive of this project is to get familiar with the Dart Programming Language.

## Try it
You can try the text editor in this link [Text Editor](https://ram535.github.io/dart_text_editor/part23/part23.html).

Check the [Source Code](https://github.com/ram535/dart_text_editor).

## Tutorial
In this tutorial I explain how to create the text editor using the dart:html library.
I try to explain it step by step so begginers can understand every part of the code.
The tutorial is divided in many parts intentionaly and in each new part we are going
to explain or add something new that will help us develop the text editor.
